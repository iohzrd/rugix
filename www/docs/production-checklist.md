# Production Checklist

Here is a rough checklist of things to consider before deploying anything to production.

:::warning

**This list is provided on a best-effort basis and makes no claim of being comprehensive.** We are not responsible for any issues you may run into. **As Rugix itself, this list comes without any warranties, whether express or implied.**

## System Size

Make sure that you have [configured a system size](./ctrl/bootstrapping.mdx#default-layout) that will be sufficient as your system evolves.
While possible, growing the system partitions in production is a potentially risky and complex endeavour and not supported by Rugix.
