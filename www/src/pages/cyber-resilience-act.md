# Navigating the Cyber Resilience Act with Rugix

The *Cyber Resilience Act* (CRA) is about to reshape how connected devices and software products are developed, maintained, and brought to market in the European Union. Whether you're building smart devices, industrial systems, or embedded Linux platforms, **CRA compliance will not be optional**—and the time to prepare is now.

## What is the CRA, and Why Should You Care?

The CRA is an upcoming EU regulation that introduces mandatory cybersecurity requirements for all products with digital elements. That includes everything from IoT devices and networked appliances to firmware and embedded Linux distributions. If you manufacture, import, or distribute such products within the EU, you will be expected to:

- Ensure products are **secure by design**.
- Maintain a clear and **up-to-date Software Bill of Materials** (SBOM).
- Provide **timely security updates** throughout the product's lifecycle.
- Establish **processes for vulnerability handling** and incident reporting.

In short, you must not only build secure systems—you must also prove they are secure, traceable, and maintained.

## How Rugix Helps You Prepare

Rugix is designed for building and managing robust embedded Linux systems. From day one, Rugix has focused on security, maintainability, and updateability—qualities that align closely with CRA requirements.

Here’s how Rugix fits into your CRA compliance journey:

-  **SBOM Generation with Rugix Bakery.** Rugix Bakery builds tailored Linux distributions and automatically generates SBOMs as part of the build process. These machine-readable lists of included components are a core requirement of CRA compliance and crucial for vulnerability management and documentation.
- **Updates with Rugix Ctrl.** Rugix Ctrl provides a reliable and secure over-the-air update mechanism, allowing you to push security updates promptly—another cornerstone of CRA compliance.

Together, these tools give you a **solid technical foundation** for meeting your legal obligations.

## Compliance Is More Than Just Updates

While Rugix takes care of critical infrastructure—like SBOMs and updates—CRA compliance requires more than just the right tooling. It involves organizational processes, product lifecycle planning, risk management, and often, tailoring solutions to your specific device and deployment landscape.
