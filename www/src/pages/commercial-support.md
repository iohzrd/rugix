# Commercial Support

Rugix has been created by [Silitics](https://silitics.com), a young and aspiring software development and consulting company.

With Rugix, our mission is to **empower you to build innovative and robust devices with ease**.
Complementing our [open-source commitment](./open-source-commitment), we offer comprehensive commercial support tailored to your needs.

Here are some examples of concrete services that we offer:

- We can **take over system development** from you, allowing you to focus on your application.
- We can **advise you on system development** (with Rugix) and make sure any potential issues are flagged early.
- We can **advise you on fleet management solutions** and everything surrounding remote updates.
- We can **develop custom integrations** for more advanced setups, for instance:
    + **Setups with secure boot and encrypted storage, preventing manipulations and protecting your IP.**
    + Non-A/B setups with a recovery system triggered by a dead man's switch (or some other means).
- We can **develop an integration for other devices** not supported by Rugix Bakery out of the box.
- We can **develop an integration with other Linux distributions** not supported by Rugix Bakery out of the box.

In addition to tailored services, we also offer an _enterprise subscription_ for companies using Rugix in their products.
The enterprise subscription includes **long-term support** for selected Rugix versions, **tailored advice and consulting** for your product, **priority email support** in case you run into any issues, **direct influence on Rugix's roadmap**, and access to an **enterprise library** with ready-made integrations[^library-wip] for a variety of different use cases and common challenges.

[^library-wip]: This library is currently work in progress. We will add and expand it as Rugix's adoption grows.
